# better_comment_scraper

<h1>comment_scraper.py</h1>

<p>This script can do a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse a webpage at a URL for HTML comments</li>
<li>Store those comments in a text file or MySQL database</li>
<li>Parse other webpages on the same site that are linked to the first page or subsequent pages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Basically, it's a cool comment parser with a few decent storage options and some really crummy spidering functionality.</h3>
<p>The hope is that this tool could be used to find things that are hidden in webpages that should be removed. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employee names</li>
  <li>IP addresses</li>
  <li>Testing data</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage is really simple. </p>
